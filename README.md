# Feature-Selection-from-XGBOOST---r
The files contain 4 different methods of feature selection methods using on a tree based algorithm (XGBOOST).
The methods include, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Reverse Elimination, Boruta, Shap.
The metric for identifying important features are based on model performance such as AUC, Accuracy and Sensitivity.
